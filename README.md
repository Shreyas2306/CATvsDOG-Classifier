# CatvsDog-Classifier---Keras

Convolutional Neural Network to classify images as either cat or dog. 
Trained using keras.
This is a basic classification example notebook for beginners who are starting with **Deep Learning**.

## Dataset:
 You can find the data set [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data).
## Problem statement

In this Section we are implementing Convolution Neural Network(CNN) Classifier for Classifying dog and cat images. The Total number of images available for training is 2,000.

## Dependencies

- Pandas
- OS
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Keras
